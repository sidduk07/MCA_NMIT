# MCA @ Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology (NMIT)

This repository serves as your one-stop shop for all your MCA course materials at Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, meticulously organized by semester and subject. Here, you'll find comprehensive notes, valuable resources, and well-structured lab programs to empower your learning journey throughout the MCA program.

## Repository Structure

The repository adheres to a clear directory structure, making it easy to navigate and locate the resources you need:

* **semesters:** This directory acts as the backbone, containing subdirectories for each semester of your MCA program (e.g., `semester-1`, `semester-2`, ..., `semester-N`).
    * Inside each semester directory, you'll find subject-specific subdirectories (e.g., `java`, `mathematics`, `database-management-systems`, etc.).
        * Each subject directory will house (add or remove as needed):
            * **course-notes:** In-depth notes covering the fundamental concepts of the subject.
            * **resources:** A curated collection of supplementary materials to enrich your understanding (online tutorials, textbooks, sample exercises, cheat sheets, etc.).
            * **lab-programs** (optional): Well-structured lab programs for subjects that involve practical application (e.g., Java, C++, Data Structures). Each program should include clear filenames, descriptive comments, meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and compilation/execution instructions (if applicable).
            * **assignments** (optional): A dedicated directory for assignments or projects specific to the subject.
